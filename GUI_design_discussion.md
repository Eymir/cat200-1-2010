Hi all,

GUI design discussion here.

I'm trying out is this the way to do discussion over here at google code.

Alright folks, I've uploaded my version of GUI design. Note that it is only a DRAFT and it's done only using WINDOWS PAINT! Please leave comment and discuss about my design regarding weaknesses, need to add something else, improvement and etc. And also, try your best to upload your own version of draft GUI design here. And we shall have our discussion over here.

Thank you.


Regards,
Steven
